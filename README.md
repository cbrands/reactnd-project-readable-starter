# Readable

This project is the second project for Udacity's React - Redux course. This is a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server created by Udacity and a frontend created by the student.
